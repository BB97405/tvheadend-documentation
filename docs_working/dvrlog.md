The DVR log is split into a series of paged grids:

-   **Upcoming Recordings** - events that are scheduled to be recorded
    in the future
-   **Finished Recordings** - events that have succesfully finished
    recording
-   **Failed Recordings** - events that failed to record

Use the bottom toolbar to navigate between pages in the grid.

Note that the columns are sortable, but only the current view will be
sorted (by default, this will be the first page of the most recent
events). Select more events per page if you want to sort a longer
selection.

To see more details about a recorded event, just click on it and a pop
up will appear:

In this pop up you can cancel a scheduled recording or abort a recording
in progress. To close the pop up, just close it with the [X] window
button.
